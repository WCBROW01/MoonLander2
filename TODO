- General additions for game:
	- Reduce intensity of "jiggle" when you land
	- Create menu system
	- Create real title screen (requires menu)
	- Switchable controls, more supported control schemes
	- Create map editor (either outside of game, or built in) (In progress!)
		- It does not need to run on everything that the game does, it can be an optional component.
	- Procedural level generation
	- Support more formats than just BMP

- Add the following to the map file spec:
	- Tile attributes (will increase size)
	- Use extra bits from this addition to increase tile limit (to 256?)

- API changes:
	- Embed font.bmp into the program (maybe)
	- Allow changing the color of text in font API (both by calling a function, and using escape codes)
