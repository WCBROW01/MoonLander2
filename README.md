# Moon Lander 2

The sequel to [Moon Lander](https://github.com/WCBROW01/MoonLander_WCB/), my final project for my second semester computer science class.

Rather than being constrained to Java and Swing, as determined by the course curriculum, I can use whatever I want, so this is written in C using SDL 2. If I can avoid having any other dependencies, I will.

Why did I decide to make this? I have no idea. The first project is just a meme among some of my friends. However, I do have a few goals for this project:

- [ ] It should feel like an actual game.
- [x] It will have 2D motion.
- [x] It will have a larger more detailed board, with real terrain. (maybe procedurally generated?)
- [x] The camera will either change size as you get higher (akin to the Atari game), or scroll.
- [ ] Just generally act more like the Atari lunar lander game.
- [ ] Run on a wide variety of platforms.
- [ ] Include a map editor. (either internal or external)

Regardless, this is mostly an excuse for me to do some graphics programming, so donâ€™t actually expect any of this to be here.

Special thanks to [Jerrin Redmon](https://github.com/CircuitBread0111) for the excellent sprites. You have contributed greatly to society with this.

## External assets

Currently the only external asset is the in-game font, which is distributed with the source code.

The font currently in use is [Public Pixel Font](https://ggbot.itch.io/public-pixel-font) version 1.0, created by [GGBotNet](https://www.ggbot.net/fonts/). It has been modified to be used as a bitmap font, and only the ASCII characterset is included.

## Building using Unix tools

To build on Unix or Windows using MinGW-w64, you only need to install SDL 2 and run `make`

On Linux or macOS, you can get this from your package manager. Windows builds using MSYS2 and MinGW-w64 have been successfully created and require no modifications to the source code.

Example for Debian/Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
```

## Building using Visual Studio

Building the project under Visual Studio is a bit more complicated, since it isn't my main development platform. (Currently, this is Ubuntu 22.04.)
However, it is at least possible to do, and may be refined in the future. If this breaks, please let me know, or send in a contribution to fix it.

If your system isn't already set up to use the SDL 2 library, you can provide a specific build for the project yourself somewhat easily.
First you'll want to grab the SDL 2 development libraries from the [SDL 2 download page](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php). Grab the file specifically for Visual C++.

The project is set up such that you can just drop the contents of the archive into `.\libs\SDL2`. After that, you should be able to drop the DLL for the CPU architecture you want to build into the project root and hit the build button for whatever configuration you would like to use.
