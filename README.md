# Moon Lander 2

The sequel to [Moon Lander](https://github.com/WCBROW01/MoonLander_WCB/), my final project for my second semester computer science class.

Rather than being constrained to Java and Swing, as determined by the course curriculum, I can use whatever I want, so this is written in C using SDL 2. If I can avoid having any other dependencies, I will.

Why did I decide to make this? I have no idea. The first project is just a meme among some of my friends. However, I do have a few goals for this project:

- [ ] It should feel like an actual game.
- [x] It will have 2D motion.
- [x] It will have a larger more detailed board, with real terrain. (maybe procedurally generated?)
- [x] The camera will either change size as you get higher (akin to the Atari game), or scroll.
- [ ] Just generally act more like the Atari lunar lander game.
- [ ] Run on a wide variety of platforms.
- [ ] Include a map editor. (either internal or external)

Regardless, this is mostly an excuse for me to do some graphics programming, so donâ€™t actually expect any of this to be here.

Special thanks to [Jerrin Redmon](https://github.com/CircuitBread0111) for the excellent sprites. You have contributed greatly to society with this.

## External assets

Currently the only external asset is the in-game font, which is distributed with the source code.

The font currently in use is [Public Pixel Font](https://ggbot.itch.io/public-pixel-font) version 1.0, created by [GGBotNet](https://www.ggbot.net/fonts/). It has been modified to be used as a bitmap font, and only the ASCII characterset is included.

## Building

To build, you only need to install SDL 2 and run `make`

On Linux or macOS, you can get this from your package manager. Windows builds using MSYS2 and MinGW-w64 have been successfully created and require no modifications to the source code.

Example for Debian/Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
```
