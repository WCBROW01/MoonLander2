# ML2 Map Editor

This is currently a work in progress. So far, it only displays the test map and has empty dialogs.
While there is a Makefile present in here, this program should not be built with it directly. Instead, you should run `make ml2-editor` in the root directory of the project.

## Dependencies

Along with everything required for the main game, you need [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/).
All you need to do is clone the master branch into the directory `imgui`, within this directory.
